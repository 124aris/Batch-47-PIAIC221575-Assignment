/* Q23: Conditional Tests: Write a series of conditional tests.
Print a statement describing each test and your prediction for the results of each test.
Your code should look something like this:
let car = 'subaru';
console.log("Is car == 'subaru'? I predict True.")
console.log(car == 'subaru')
• Look closely at your results, and make sure you understand why each line evaluates to True or False.
• Create at least 10 tests. Have at least 5 tests evaluate to True and another 5 tests evaluate to False. */

//First Conditional Test

let car: string = "Subaru";

console.log("Question: Is car == 'Subaru'?\nPrediction: I predict True.");

console.log(`Answer: ${car == 'Subaru'}\n`);

//Second Conditional Test

let planet: string = "Earth";

console.log("Question: Is planet == 'Mercury'?\nPrediction: I predict False.");

console.log(`Answer: ${planet == 'Mercury'}\n`);

//Third Conditional Test

let day: string = "Sunday";

console.log("Question: Is day == 'Sunday'?\nPrediction: I predict True.");

console.log(`Answer: ${day == 'Sunday'}\n`);

//Fourth Conditional Test

let month: string = "August";

console.log("Question: Is month == 'January'?\nPrediction: I predict False.");

console.log(`Answer: ${month == 'January'}\n`);

//Fifth Conditional Test

let watch: string = "Casio";

console.log("Question: Is watch == 'Casio'?\nPrediction: I predict True.");

console.log(`Answer: ${watch == 'Casio'}\n`);

//Sixth Conditional Test

let favNum: number = 14;

console.log("Question: Is favNum == 6?\nPrediction: I predict False.");

console.log(`Answer: ${favNum == 6}\n`);

//Seventh Conditional Test

let oddNum: number = 7;

console.log("Question: Is oddNum == 7?\nPrediction: I predict True.");

console.log(`Answer: ${oddNum == 7}\n`);

//Eight Coditionall Test

let evenNum: number = 4;

console.log("Question: Is evenNum == 8?\nPrediction: I predict False.");

console.log(`Answer: ${evenNum == 6}\n`);

//Ninth Conditional Test

let Num: number = 5;

console.log("Question: Is Num == 5?\nPrediction: I predict True.");

console.log(`Answer: ${Num == 5}\n`);

//Tenth Condition Test

let luckyNum: number = 6;

console.log("Question: Is luckyNum == 3?\nPrediction: I predict False.");

console.log(`Answer: ${luckyNum == 3}\n`);
